# String Transformer

Generates a new longer string.

I'm still working on this, I will add more features to it.

## Installation

``$ npm i string_transformer``

## Usage

```javascript
var transform = require('string_transformer');
transform('Hello World!');
```
You will get something like this:
```javascript
"oAp68dM8Cg6DSv0UDNTrtYwkghSFfGCSa3dpeYZyjT45NJTIlP"
```
